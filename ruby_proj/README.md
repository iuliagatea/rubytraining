## Requirements

A basic kownledge of GIT is required to be able to do this assignement.

If you don't know what I'm talking about than you should follow the next 2 links before working on your assignement:

- https://try.github.io
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/ (the Getting Started section)

## Guidelines

- put your code in the `src/ folder
- solve the levels in ascending order
- commit your code at the end of each level (you should have 1 commit per level)
- even if you have a look at the higher levels, **please do the simplest thing that works for the level you are currently solving**
- each level builds on the previous one so don't be afraid to rewrite/refactor things between levels as needed
- once you are done, ping me by email


We want to see code that is

- OOP
- simple (don't try to do more than is needed)
- clean
- robust (don't overlook edge cases)

## Hints

An object-oriented program usually consists of a number of objects that interact with each other, as opposed to a procedural programming style, in which a program consists of a list of procedures that are performed.
